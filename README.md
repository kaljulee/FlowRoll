# FlowRoll

From the documentation: 


>The problem
>
>Given a single rolling spot and four rollers, create an optimized rolling matchup schedule.  As an unrelated issue, our timer is a free trial version with reduced features.  
>
>The Solution
>
>Creating our own timer is an opportunity to figure out what math describes the problem of mat scheduling.  The timer will organize a schedule based around some TBD default optimization (probably some sort of even distribution of everyone vs everyone), and perform the function of a 1round/1break timer.  Thereâ€™s a bunch of possible features to add after that.  



Made with React Native, somewhat overbuilt with unnecessary custom component wrappers.
This is still actively being worked on; I am considering scaling it down to just a scheduler, and assume use with an independent timer.  Or maybe not!  Only time will tell.

You can read more about how I am approaching the problem here.
